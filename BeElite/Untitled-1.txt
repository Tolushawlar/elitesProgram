1. Get list of the unsorted numbers store as unsortedNum
2. Get the length of the list of unsorted numbers can store as NumLen
3. Repeat this steps until no swaps are made again:
    Set a a boolean variable swapped value as false
    Loop from list index of 0 to NumLen - 1:
        compare unsortedNum[i] with unsortedNum[i+1]
        if unsortedNum[i] > unsortedNum[i+1]:
            swap(move position) unsortedNum[i] with unsortedNum[i+1]
            set swapped to true 
4. Output the result of unsorted
